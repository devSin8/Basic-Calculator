This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across different screen sizes.

### Features

    Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    Clear Function: Allows users to reset the calculator.
    Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for different device sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
    Interactive UI: Buttons provide immediate feedback upon interaction.

### Technologies Used

    HTML: Structure of the calculator and buttons.
    CSS: Styling the calculator for an aesthetic and user-friendly design.
    JavaScript: Logic for performing the arithmetic operations and updating the display.

### How to Use the Calculator

  Clone the Repository:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/devSin8/basic-calculator-website.git

Navigate to the Project Directory:

    bash

### Project Structure
```
bash

basic-calculator-website/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file containing the structure of the calculator
├── styles.css        # CSS file for styling the calculator
└── script.js         # JavaScript file for calculator logic
```

### Files Explanation:

  index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the calculator, with buttons for numbers, operations, and the display area.
  styles.css: Adds styling to the calculator, including button layouts, fonts, and colors.
  script.js: Contains the JavaScript logic for handling button clicks and performing arithmetic calculations.

### How It Works

  HTML defines the structure of the calculator interface (buttons, display).
  CSS makes it look visually appealing and responsive to different screen sizes.
  JavaScript handles the logic behind the calculator, including:
        Storing inputs.
        Performing operations when the "=" button is pressed.
        Clearing the display with the "C" button.


### Future Improvements

  Scientific Calculator Features: Addition of more complex operations like square root, exponentiation, etc.
  Keyboard Support: Adding support for using the keyboard to input numbers and operations.
